			<h2 id="api_key">Api Key</h2>

			These are used to authenticate you with the server and will determine the permission level you have. For certain requests you must have a certain permission level (See <a href="#force_update">Force Update</a>).<br> The syntax for it is the following:<br>
			<br>
			<pre><code>api_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</code></pre>
			<br>
			Api key's are required in all queries made towards the API.<br>

			<h2 id="force_update">Force Update</h2>

			Force update is a restricted parameter that requires a high permission level. It tells the server to update it's local cache, and therefore can be quite slow to run depending on the endpoint chosen.<br>
			<br>
			The syntax for it is the folowing:<br>
			<br>
			<pre><code>force_update=true</code></pre>
			<br>
			This parameter is <b>optional</b> for all endpoints, and is only valid if you have the afforementioned permission level required.<br>

			<h2 id="length">Length</h2>

			Length determines the size of the response the server provides. e.g. setting length to 100 for read_players will return <b>only</b> the first 100 players. The maximum length that this parameter accepts is 100000, requesting more than this will cause the API to respond with false.<br>
			<br>
			The syntax for it is the following:<br>
			<br>
			<pre><code>length=XXXXX</code></pre>
			<br>
			This parameter is optional, and defaults to 100 when not provided.<br>

			<h2 id="offset">Offset</h2>

			Offset determines the starting location in the list that the server provides (length) results of. E.g. using <code>&offset=50</code> with no length parameter (length defaults to 100 when not provided) would return players from position 50->150, using offsset of 100 would return 100->200 etc.<br>
			<br>
			The syntax for it is the following:<br>
			<pre><code>offset=XXXXX</code></pre>
			<br>
			This parameter is optional, and defaults to 0 when not provided.

			<h2 id="steam_id">Steam ID64</h2>

			Steam ID64 is the most commonly used form of Steam ID. You can get it through looking at the end of your profile URL (steamcommunity.com/id/76499999999999) <b>or if you have a custom URL</b> you can easily get it through online services such as <a href="https://steamid.io/">steamid.io</a>.<br>
			<br>
			The syntax for it is the following:<br>
			<br>
			<pre><code>steam_id=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</code></pre>
			<br>
			For endpoints <a href="../read_player_steam_id">read_player_steam_id</a> and <a href="../read_match_detail_steam_id">read_match_detail_steam_id</a> this field is required as those return data for an individual player. For other endpoints this field is not in use.<br>
